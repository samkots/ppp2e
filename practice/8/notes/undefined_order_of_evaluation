Some examples with undefined order of evaluation. Don't do that.	/!\

v[i] = ++i;
v[++i] = i;
int x = ++i + ++i;
cout << ++i << ' ' << i << '\n';
f(++i, ++i)



Reference: ppp2e 8.6.1 Expression evaluation, pg292

"There is a simple rule that can keep you out of trouble: if you change the value
of a variable in an expression, don't read or write it twice in that same
expression."
